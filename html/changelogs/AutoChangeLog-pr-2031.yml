changes:
  - imageadd: SolGov stamps are now a thing! Use them to give your documentation some
      Solarian approval!
  - rscadd: You can now put halberds on your back slot!
  - bugfix: Adjusted some outfit code further, making it all fully functional *and*
      compliant!
  - balance: The SolGov vacsuit now has a more environmental protection focus and
      the SolGov hardsuit had its radiation protection toned down.
