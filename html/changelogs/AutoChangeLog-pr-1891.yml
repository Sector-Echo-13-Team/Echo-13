changes:
  - balance: Goliaths, Ice whelps, and Whitesands basilisks should be easier to kill
      now. Try AP ammo.
  - balance: Crushers no longer drop from legion bodies, only old crushers.
  - balance: Tweaked how crushers distribute their damage.
  - balance: Survivor suits no longer make you run at hyperspeed
  - balance: Laser weaponry should be a little more effective versus most common fauna.
  - bugfix: Added a sound to help show when a whitesands basilisk absorbs a bullet
